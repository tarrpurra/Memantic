## Introduction - <u>Built for creators. Powered by culture. Minted on-chain.</u>

![Introduction](./images/3.jpg)

Memetic is a Web3-native platform that uses AI to generate memes and mints top-rated content as NFTs.

## How It Works
![How It Works](./images/4.jpg)
Users submit prompts, generate memes via AI, vote or stake ICP on the best ones, and earn when memes go viral.

## Tech Stack
![Tech Stack](./images/5.jpg)
Built on Internet Computer (ICP) using React for frontend, Rust/Motoko Canisters for backend, and t-ECDSA for secure NFT minting.

## On-Chain Architecture
All content and voting logic is fully on-chain. AI integration is handled via HTTP outcalls to external APIs.

## Features

- AI meme generation
- MemeStaking
- Community voting
- NFT minting with royalties
- On-chain meme gallery

## Monetization

## Roadmap
Future roadmap includes:
- MemeDAO for curation
- Trending prompt engine
- Meme agents that adapt to culture
- Cross-platform meme analytics

## Team
Team consists of fullstack developers, AI specialists, Web3 designers, and growth leads with strong ICP knowledge.

## Submission Summary
The product demonstrates full-stack Web3 development, smart contract complexity, and innovative use of AI and decentralized storage.

Submitted to WCHL25 with full GitHub repo, documentation.

If you want to start working on your project right away, you might want to try the following commands:

```bash
cd Memantic/
dfx help
dfx canister --help
```

## Running the project locally

If you want to test your project locally, you can use the following commands:

```bash
# Starts the replica, running in the background
dfx start --background

# Deploys your canisters to the replica and generates your candid interface
dfx deploy
```

Once the job completes, your application will be available at `http://localhost:4943?canisterId={asset_canister_id}`.

If you have made changes to your backend canister, you can generate a new candid interface with

```bash
npm run generate
```

at any time. This is recommended before starting the frontend development server, and will be run automatically any time you run `dfx deploy`.

If you are making frontend changes, you can start a development server with

```bash
npm start
```

Which will start a server at `http://localhost:8080`, proxying API requests to the replica at port 4943.

### Note on frontend environment variables

If you are hosting frontend code somewhere without using DFX, you may need to make one of the following adjustments to ensure your project does not fetch the root key in production:

- set`DFX_NETWORK` to `ic` if you are using Webpack
- use your own preferred method to replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` in the autogenerated declarations
  - Setting `canisters -> {asset_canister_id} -> declarations -> env_override to a string` in `dfx.json` will replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` with the string in the autogenerated declarations
- Write your own `createActor` constructor
